### Notes

<details><summary>High-Level Math Model of Arduino UNO Using Python</summary>
<br>

The provided Python implementation models an Arduino UNO by simulating its key features, including its microcontroller, I/O pins, timers, and communication interfaces. The model is encapsulated within the ArduinoUNO class, which manages various components such as digital and analog pins, memory, and timers. The class includes methods to simulate fundamental Arduino functions like pinMode, digitalWrite, digitalRead, analogWrite, and analogRead. These methods mimic the behavior of the actual Arduino hardware, allowing users to set and read the states of pins, simulate analog input and output, and configure pin modes.

The program also includes a clock simulation that keeps track of timing. This is crucial for implementing functions like delay, which is based on the Arduinoâ€™s 16 MHz clock speed. The clock is managed in a separate thread, which increments a simulation time variable in real-time. This allows the model to simulate the passing of time and the execution of time-dependent functions, such as PWM signals on specific pins or delaying operations.

In addition to the basic pin and timing simulations, the model includes stubs for communication interfaces such as UART, SPI, and I2C. The uart_write and uart_read methods provide a simple buffer mechanism for UART communication, allowing the simulation of serial data transfer. The SPI and I2C methods are placeholders that can be further developed to simulate specific protocol behaviors. These communication interfaces are essential for simulating interactions with other devices in more complex Arduino projects.

The run_program method is a feature that allows users to simulate running a simple Arduino sketch within this Python environment. By using Python's exec function, it can dynamically execute a sequence of commands, mimicking how an Arduino would run a program in its loop. This method can be expanded to handle more complex program logic and interrupt-driven operations, making the simulation more versatile.

Overall, this implementation provides a foundation for simulating an Arduino UNO, capturing its key functionalities in a Python environment. The model is designed to be modular, with the potential for expanding features like more detailed communication protocols, enhanced timer functionalities, and external interrupts. This simulation can be useful for testing and validating Arduino code in a controlled environment before deploying it to actual hardware. Additionally, the code can be extended with a graphical user interface or additional features based on specific project needs.
