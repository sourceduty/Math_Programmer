### Notes

<details><summary>High-Level Simulated Math Model of Arduino UNO</summary>
<br>

The provided Python implementation models an Arduino UNO by simulating its key features, including its microcontroller, I/O pins, timers, and communication interfaces. The model is encapsulated within the ArduinoUNO class, which manages various components such as digital and analog pins, memory, and timers. The class includes methods to simulate fundamental Arduino functions like pinMode, digitalWrite, digitalRead, analogWrite, and analogRead. These methods mimic the behavior of the actual Arduino hardware, allowing users to set and read the states of pins, simulate analog input and output, and configure pin modes.

The program also includes a clock simulation that keeps track of timing. This is crucial for implementing functions like delay, which is based on the Arduino’s 16 MHz clock speed. The clock is managed in a separate thread, which increments a simulation time variable in real-time. This allows the model to simulate the passing of time and the execution of time-dependent functions, such as PWM signals on specific pins or delaying operations.

In addition to the basic pin and timing simulations, the model includes stubs for communication interfaces such as UART, SPI, and I2C. The uart_write and uart_read methods provide a simple buffer mechanism for UART communication, allowing the simulation of serial data transfer. The SPI and I2C methods are placeholders that can be further developed to simulate specific protocol behaviors. These communication interfaces are essential for simulating interactions with other devices in more complex Arduino projects.

The run_program method is a feature that allows users to simulate running a simple Arduino sketch within this Python environment. By using Python's exec function, it can dynamically execute a sequence of commands, mimicking how an Arduino would run a program in its loop. This method can be expanded to handle more complex program logic and interrupt-driven operations, making the simulation more versatile.

Overall, this implementation provides a foundation for simulating an Arduino UNO, capturing its key functionalities in a Python environment. The model is designed to be modular, with the potential for expanding features like more detailed communication protocols, enhanced timer functionalities, and external interrupts. This simulation can be useful for testing and validating Arduino code in a controlled environment before deploying it to actual hardware. Additionally, the code can be extended with a graphical user interface or additional features based on specific project needs.

Arduino UNO Simulation as a Mathematical Model

This mathematical model represents the key functionalities of an Arduino UNO microcontroller by abstracting its hardware operations into mathematical equations and functions. The model covers the behavior of the microcontroller's clock speed, digital and analog pin states, PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) outputs, memory operations, timers, and communication protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C. Each of these components is modeled to reflect how they would behave in response to various inputs and over time. This model serves as a theoretical framework to understand and predict the microcontroller's performance in different scenarios, providing a simplified yet accurate representation of the Arduino UNO's functionality.

```
1. Clock Speed and Timing

   Clock Cycles (C): The Arduino UNO has a clock speed of 16 MHz, meaning it executes 16 million cycles per second.
   
   C(t) = 16 × 10^6 × t
   
   where t is time in seconds.

2. Digital Pin State

   Digital Pin State (D(p)): Each digital pin can either be HIGH (1) or LOW (0). Let D(p, t) represent the state of pin p at time t.
   
   D(p, t) ∈ {0, 1}
   
   A function can be used to change the state based on a control input:
   
   D(p, t + Δt) = ControlInput(p, t)

3. Analog Pin Reading

   Analog Input (A(p)): Analog pins read a voltage level and convert it to a digital value between 0 and 1023.
   
   A(p, t) = ⌊ V(p, t) / V_ref × 1023 ⌋
   
   where V(p, t) is the voltage at pin p at time t, and V_ref is the reference voltage (typically 5V).

4. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

   PWM Output (P(p, t)): PWM simulates analog output using digital signals. The duty cycle determines the average voltage.
   
   P(p, t) = V_out × d(p, t) / 255
   
   where d(p, t) is the PWM duty cycle value (0-255), and V_out is the output voltage (typically 5V).

5. Memory Operations

   Flash, SRAM, EEPROM (M(m, t)): Memory contents change over time based on program execution.
   
   M(m, t + Δt) = f(M(m, t), ProgramInstructions)
   
   where M(m, t) represents the state of memory m at time t, and f is a function representing the effect of executing program instructions.

6. Timers

   Timer (T(n, t)): The timers count clock cycles and can trigger actions after specific intervals.
   
   T(n, t) = C(t) mod TimerInterval(n)
   
   where T(n, t) is the value of timer n at time t.

7. UART, SPI, I2C Communication

   Data Transfer: These peripherals can be represented by functions that model the data flow between components.
   
   UART: U(t) = TransmitData
   SPI: S(t) = SPITransferData
   I2C: I(t) = I2CTransferData

Mathematical Model Overview

1. Clock Cycles:
   C(t) = 16 × 10^6 × t

2. Digital Pin State:
   D(p, t + Δt) = ControlInput(p, t)

3. Analog Pin Reading:
   A(p, t) = ⌊ V(p, t) / V_ref × 1023 ⌋

4. PWM Output:
   P(p, t) = V_out × d(p, t) / 255

5. Memory State:
   M(m, t + Δt) = f(M(m, t), ProgramInstructions)

6. Timer:
   T(n, t) = C(t) mod TimerInterval(n)

7. Communication Data Transfer:
   U(t), S(t), I(t) modeled by data transfer functions

Example Application

If a digital pin is set high after a delay:

1. Set Pin Mode:
   ControlInput(13, t) sets D(13, t) = 1

2. Delay:
   DelayTime = 1000 ms
   t_new = t + (DelayTime / 1000)

3. Read Pin:
   D(13, t_new)
```

This abstraction can be expanded further to fully represent the system behavior mathematically. However, it's important to note that this abstraction is simplified and would require more detailed equations and conditions to fully replicate the Arduino UNO's hardware functionality.

<details><summary>AA Battery Life Estimation</summary>
<br>

This program aims to estimate how long an AA battery will last when powering a device. By knowing the battery's capacity in milliamp-hours (mAh) and the device's current draw in milliamps (mA), you can easily calculate the battery life using a simple formula.

Problem Statement:

You want to estimate how long an AA battery will last when powering a device. You know the battery's capacity in milliamp-hours (mAh) and the device's current draw in milliamps (mA).

Assumptions:

- The battery discharges at a constant rate.
- The capacity of the battery is given in milliamp-hours (mAh).
- The current draw of the device is constant and given in milliamps (mA).

Formula:

The battery life in hours can be calculated using the formula:

Battery Life (hours) = Battery Capacity (mAh) / Device Current Draw (mA)

Example Input:

Battery Capacity: 2400 mAh (typical for AA alkaline batteries)
Device Current Draw: 100 mA

Example Calculation:

Battery Life = 2400 mAh / 100 mA = 24 hours

#### Implementation in Python

This program takes the battery capacity and the device's current draw as inputs and calculates the estimated battery life in hours. You can modify the capacity and current_draw variables to match your specific requirements. The program also includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.

```
def calculate_battery_life(capacity_mAh, current_draw_mA):
    """
    Calculate the battery life in hours based on battery capacity and device current draw.
    
    Parameters:
    capacity_mAh (float): The capacity of the battery in milliamp-hours (mAh).
    current_draw_mA (float): The current draw of the device in milliamps (mA).
    
    Returns:
    float: Estimated battery life in hours.
    """
    if current_draw_mA <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Current draw must be a positive value.")
    if capacity_mAh <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Battery capacity must be a positive value.")
        
    battery_life_hours = capacity_mAh / current_draw_mA
    return battery_life_hours

# Example usage:
capacity = 2400  # mAh
current_draw = 100  # mA
battery_life = calculate_battery_life(capacity, current_draw)
print(f"Estimated Battery Life: {battery_life} hours")
```
